# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using Python & NLP

A machine learning project that analyzes text data and predicts sentiment — whether it's **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. Built using Python and NLP libraries, this project showcases real-world applications like opinion mining, product reviews, and social media sentiment tracking.

## Features

- Classifies text sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
- Accepts custom user input or bulk text files
- Preprocesses text using tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- `scikit-learn` – for ML algorithms
- `pandas`, `numpy` – for data manipulation
- `nltk` – for text preprocessing
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – for visualizations (optional)
